# GenPsych Lecture Slides

These are lecture slides ("powerpoints") for the [Principles of Psychology and Neuroscience](https://github.com/PsychNeuro/ed1) textbook.

The `.pdf` format is a 6-per-page "handout" format recommended for note taking if you must print them out.

The slides in `old` are obsolete, based on standard textbooks, and will deleted once everything is updated.
